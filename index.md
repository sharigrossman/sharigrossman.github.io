<p class="lead text-justify">
I am a computational biologist with a special interest in emerging computational and experimental methods in genomics and gene regulation. I am currently in the Harvard/MIT MD-PhD program and completed my PhD with [Eric Lander](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bios/eric-s-lander), studying how gene regulation is encoded in enhancer sequences in mammalian genomes. Before that, I worked as a research technician with Pardis Sabeti at Harvard University developing statistical methods to detect alleles undergoing positive selection in the human genome. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Chemical and Physical Biology at Harvard University, where I worked with Erin O'Shea investigating gene regulation in stress response pathways in yeast.   
Outside of science, I love running, hiking, poetry, yoga, and travel.
